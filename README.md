# Image Classification Using Support Vector Machine for Cats and Dogs

## Introduction:
Image classification is a fundamental task in machine learning and computer vision. This project aims to implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify images of cats and dogs, using a dataset from the Kaggle competition "Dogs vs. Cats". The process involves data extraction, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## About the Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle competition "Dogs vs. Cats". It contains thousands of images of cats and dogs, which are labeled accordingly. The images come in various sizes and need to be preprocessed to a uniform size for the SVM model. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and is from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

## Project Objective:
The objective is to develop an SVM model that can accurately classify images of cats and dogs by leveraging preprocessing techniques and feature extraction for a robust classification performance.

## Methodology:
- Data Extraction: Extract the images from the provided zip files and organize them into training and testing directories.

- Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the images by resizing them to a uniform size, scaling the pixel values, and flattening the images for feature extraction.

- Model Training: Implement the SVM algorithm and use GridSearchCV to determine the optimal hyperparameters. Train the SVM model with the best parameters identified.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the SVM model on the validation set using accuracy as the metric. Visualize some of the correctly and incorrectly classified images.

- Prediction and Submission: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set and save the results in a CSV file for submission.

## Conclusion:
Image classification using SVM is a powerful technique applicable to various computer vision problems. This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building and evaluating an SVM model for classifying images of cats and dogs, offering a reliable solution for this common image recognition task.
